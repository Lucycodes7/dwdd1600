        <h1>About the Artist</h1>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Lucy Brown, and I was born and raised in Utah. From a young age, I have always been highly
            creative and drawn to art. I enjoyed participating in any craft that my mother or grandparents worked on,
            seizing every opportunity to create. This satisfaction I found in making things carried over into my high
            school years, where it was reflected in the courses I chose. I took many art and design classes that have
            shaped the path I am on today. One class that particularly influenced my decision to pursue graphic design
            was a year-long digital media course, which introduced me to key software used in the field, such as Adobe
            Photoshop. <br><br>After graduating high school, I enrolled at Utah Valley University to pursue a degree in art
            and
            design with an emphasis in graphic design. Currently, I am working toward this degree and was recently
            accepted into the AAS portion of the graphic design program. Recently, one of my artworks I created while
            being in this program was accepted into the student scholarship artshow! The graphic design program has been
            very rewarding for me creatively and overall it has been rewarding for me as an individual.<br>

        <h2>Principles of Design</h2>

        <p>The principles of design have been a key lesson in my
            eductation this far that have helped me to creat successful designs. </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Repetition</dt>
            <dd>Repetition is the use of the same or similar elements throughout a design. It creates consistency,
                reinforces a theme, and helps with organization.</dd>

            <dt>Variety</dt>
            <dd>Variety involves using different elements in a design to create visual interest. It contrasts repetition
                and avoids monotony, keeping the viewer engaged.</dd>

            <dt>Rhythm</dt>
            <dd>Rhythm is the movement or pattern in a design that leads the viewer's eye through the work. It creates a
                sense of flow and harmony by repeating elements in a planned way.</dd>

            <dt>Balance</dt>
            <dd>Balance refers to the distribution of visual weight within a design. It can be symmetrical,
                asymmetrical, or radial, and it ensures that the design feels stable and organized.</dd>

            <dt>Emphasis</dt>
            <dd>Emphasis highlights a particular element in a design, making it stand out. It can be achieved through
                contrast, color, size, or placement to draw attention to a focal point.</dd>

            <dt>Economy</dt>
            <dd>Economy is the principle of eliminating unnecessary elements in a design. It promotes simplicity and
                clarity, ensuring that the design remains effective and focused on the core message.</dd>

            <dt>Proportion</dt>
            <dd>Proportion refers to the relative size and scale of elements within a design. It ensures that elements
                are in harmony with each other and appear balanced in relation to their surroundings.</dd>
