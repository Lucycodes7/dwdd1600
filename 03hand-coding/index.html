        <h2>Personal Poster - Apeirophobia</h2>
        <h3>Prompt</h3>
        <p>Design a functional poster which describes an aspect or characteristic of yourself. Be creative! Take a hard
            look at
            yourself (literally and figuratively) and choose some personal attribute or aspect about yourself and
            “advertise” it with a poster. This poster design is not merely to be the creation of an image as a self
            portrait, it is the development of a poster to communicate a particular characteristic about yourself
            creatively and conceptually (in a non-obvious manner). You do not necessarily have to choose a strength or
            positive theme, but choose something that is unique about yourself. Then think of a creative way to express
            this uniqueness in an appropriate and artistic poster design.</p>

        <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
        <p>The theme of my personal poster revolves around apeirophobia, the fear of infinity, as it is something I have
            struggled with as an individual. <strong>Apeirophobia:</strong> <em>is the fear of infinity, and may be
                manifest as a
                gnawing fixation on the endlessness of space and the innumerable possibilities of time.</em> I found
            that infinity is a hard concept to represent but I ended up
            choosing space to represent infinity as space is also a big aspect of apeirophobia. I wanted to show a woman
            that represents myself, looking up and pondering. I cut out her eyes and the silhouette of the tears to
            create a window that shows that space, or infinity is what is behind her thoughts and tears. I also repeated
            the woman back into space seemingly forever, to represent her going on for infinity, as existing forever is
            also a great aspect of apeirophobia. For the Text, I chose the word “Infinite”, which can also be read as
            “In Finite” as I am an evidently finite being trying to comprehend a reality that is seemingly infinite.</p>

        <h2>Type Face Poster - Gotham</h2>
        <h3>Prompt</h3>
        <p>Design a poster that conveys a type face of your choosing, and the important information that is associated
            with the typeface. The Poster should include the following information designed in a grid format.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Typeface and typographer in question</li>
            <li>Biographic info on Typographer</li>
            <li>Historic info about the typeface, when it was created, maybe why, other interesting facts
            </li>
            <li>Type Classification of typeface (serif, san serif, best uses, etc)
            </li>
            <li>Any other interesting facts about the typographer or typeface</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Artist Statement</h3>
        <p>This poster was inspired by the typeface Gotham created by Tobias Frere-Jones and Jonathan Hoefler. The
            typeface was based on the style of type seen all around New York City. I included key information on the
            typeface and the background of its creators to help create a better understanding and appreciation for the
            renowned typeface. I chose the colors commonly associated with New York City and I was especially inspired
            by the colors of Milton Glaser’s
            “I Heart NY” logo.
